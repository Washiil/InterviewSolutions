# 🚀 LeetCode & Codewars Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I solve **LeetCode** and **Codewars** challenges. I am currently  using **Rust** 🦀 and **Python** 🐍. This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structure problems aimed at improving coding skills, enhancing problem-solving abilities, and sharpening my grasp of data structures and algorithms.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem type and platform for easier navigation. Each solution contains the problem solution and sometimes explanations for tricky or interesting problems.


### Folder Details:

Each folder contains solutions in their respective language. Due to the package managment of certain languages they will contain subfolders or simply files for each problem. All problems are labeled by their number with leading zeros for sorting.

## 📺 Platforms

### [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
LeetCode is the tried and true place for interview coding problems. It offers a vast collection of problems that range from basic to advanced levels, testing algorithmic skills and knowledge of data structures.

### [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
Codewars focuses on various Kata challenges where users are trained to improve their coding skills. Katas are ranked by difficulty, and solutions here are for challenges from `1kyu` to `7kyu` levels.

## 📂 Languages

### Python 🐍
Python is a go-to for many people solving coding problems, especially in an interview scenario. Thus, I want to make sure I am confident in my ability to implement many solutions in Python efficiently and quickly.

### Rust 🦀
Rust is a systems programming language focusing on safety, performance, and concurrency. It is ideal for writing efficient and reliable solutions to algorithmic problems. I opted to solve a lot of problems in Rust after Python as a way to continually understand the language and often understand some of the data structures on a deeper level due to the verbose nature of Rust code.

## 🚩 Future Goals 
- [ x ] Implement better standardization between all of my solutions
- [ x ] Add Golang Support
- [ ] Add Kotlin
- [ ] Add C/C++
- [ ] Perhaps add some benchmarking capabilities for my solutions (Long Term)
- [ ] Add a counter (push action?) to update the number of problems solved in the readme
